# ZARA-Modern-UI
Under the HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) module, we redesigned Zara.com to improve usability and user experience. The original site had unclear navigation, hidden menus, and poor visual cues. Our redesign focuses on clearer navigation, better visual feedback, and consistent layouts for a more intuitive shopping experience.
